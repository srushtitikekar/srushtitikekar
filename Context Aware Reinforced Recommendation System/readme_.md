# Context-Aware Reinforced Recommendation System

This repository contains the implementation of a Context-Aware Reinforced Recommendation System designed to dynamically adjust its model parameters based on user feedback. The system aims to improve the accuracy and relevance of recommendations by incorporating contextual information and user interaction data.

## Project Description

### Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a recommendation system that adapts in real-time based on user feedback. The system is designed to handle dynamic adjustment of model parameters to provide more accurate and contextually relevant recommendations.

### Context-Aware Recommender System (CARS)

A Context-Aware Recommender System (CARS) utilizes contextual information (such as user environment, time, location, and activity) to enhance the relevance of recommendations. This project applies CARS principles to improve the user experience by making recommendations that are not only personalized but also context-sensitive.

### Why Context-Aware Recommendations?

- **Improved Accuracy**: Incorporating contextual information can significantly improve the accuracy of recommendations.
- **Adaptability**: Context awareness allows the recommendation system to adapt to changes in the userâ€™s environment, making it more responsive and relevant.
- **Semantic Relationships**: The system uses knowledge discovery techniques to uncover semantic relationships between users, items, and context that influence user interactions.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Clustering and Similarity Measures

- **Approach**: The initial approach uses clustering algorithms (like k-means) and nearest neighbor techniques to generate recommendations based on course time and other variables. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is employed for similarity measurement to recommend similar courses.
- **Challenges**: This content-based approach faced challenges related to the quality of recommendations when retrieving multiple items, leading to the exploration of alternative methods.

### 2. Collaborative Filtering

- **Approach**: To avoid the limitations of content-based filtering, the project shifted to a collaborative filtering approach. This involves using TF-IDF vectorization to compare user descriptions with course descriptions, generating recommendations based on similarity scores.
- **Challenges**: Ensuring equal feature sizes for both user and course vectors was a key challenge. The solution involved shrinking and limiting the number of features to facilitate effective comparison.

### 3. Hybrid Approach

- **Ensemble Method**: The final system employs a hybrid approach combining content-based and collaborative filtering. This includes k-means clustering and TF-IDF keyword extraction to align course recommendations with users' career interests.
- **Contextual Adaptation**: The system continuously adapts by incorporating user feedback collected via API endpoints, dynamically adjusting its recommendations.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the user and course databases.
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Perform clustering and other EDA techniques to identify patterns and groupings.
3. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Use TF-IDF to calculate similarities between courses and user profiles.
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Generate recommendations using clustering and collaborative filtering methods.
5. **Evaluation**: Analyze recommendation results and refine the model.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Model Adjustment**: The system adjusts its model parameters based on user feedback, improving future recommendations.
- **Context Sensitivity**: The system adapts to the user's context, ensuring that recommendations remain relevant in varying circumstances.
- **Hybrid Recommendation Strategy**: Combines the strengths of content-based and collaborative filtering to offer a robust recommendation solution.

## Conclusion

The Context-Aware Reinforced Recommendation System successfully demonstrates the potential of context-sensitive, adaptive recommendation engines. By continuously learning from user interactions, it provides more accurate and relevant suggestions, enhancing the overall user experience.
