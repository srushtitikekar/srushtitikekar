# üí´ About Me:
üëã Hi there! I'm Srushti Tikekar, a passionate computer scientist with a keen interest in Information Retrieval and Machine Learning. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Clemson University, where I'm focused on leveraging data analysis, text processing, and machine learning models to improve search quality and user experiences.

## My Journey
I hold a Post Graduate Certification in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani, and a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from the University of Pune. Throughout my academic career, I've maintained a strong GPA, reflecting my dedication and commitment to my studies.

## Professional Experience
My professional journey has taken me from being a Technical Support Engineer at Dynatrace to a Senior Software Engineer at Wipro Limited. At Wipro, I led initiatives to analyze application performance and improve user experiences across healthcare websites. Currently, as a Graduate Research Assistant at Clemson University, I'm developing methodologies to enhance accessibility features for individuals with disabilities.

## Projects & Skills
I love working on projects that challenge my skills and push the boundaries of technology. Some of my notable projects include developing a BERT-based Question-Answer model, creating a GAN for generating fake images, and designing a video caption generation system using LSTM and GRU.

## My technical skills include:

Advanced: Python, SQL, Data Visualization, Machine Learning
Intermediate: Information Retrieval, Deep Learning, Statistical Data Analysis
Beginner: C#, Pytorch
## Achievements & Publications
I'm proud to have been recognized as a top performer at Clemson's DRIVE Lab for my work on an adaptive user interface and as Rookie of the Quarter at Wipro Limited for achieving a perfect customer satisfaction rating. Additionally, I have published research on automated calorie estimation using food images in the International Journal of Emerging Technologies and Innovative Research.

## Beyond Tech
Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I enjoy volunteering and have actively participated in various community projects through Lions Club International and EPIC, supporting education, environmental conservation, and inclusivity for individuals with special needs.
