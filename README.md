# üí´ About Me:
üëã Hi there! I'm Srushti Tikekar, a passionate AI and Machine Learning enthusiast with expertise in Python, deep learning, and scalable software design. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Clemson University, where I am focused on applying advanced machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.

## My Journey
I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science from Clemson University, where I've taken courses in Deep Learning, Information Retrieval, and Data Visualization. I also have a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from Savitribai Phule Pune University. My academic journey is complemented by a Post Graduate Certification in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from BITS Pilani.

## Professional Experience
I have experience as a Graduate Research Assistant at Clemson University, where I've developed and scaled AI algorithms, achieving high accuracy in identifying user data patterns. Previously, I worked at Wipro Limited as a Senior Software Engineer, where I optimized application performance and developed custom monitoring solutions. My technical support role at Dynatrace further honed my skills in troubleshooting and data analysis.

## Projects & Skills
I thrive on developing innovative solutions to complex problems. Some of my key projects include:

- **Context-Aware Reinforced Recommendation System**: Developed a dynamic recommendation system that adjusts model parameters based on user feedback and contextual data.
- **BERT for Question-Answering**: Fine-tuned a BERT model to generate accurate answers from input text.
- **GANs for Image Generation**: Designed and implemented ACGAN, DCGAN, and WGAN models to generate high-quality images.
- **Video Caption Generation**: Created a sequence-to-sequence model using RNNs (LSTM, GRU) to generate captions for videos.

### My technical skills include:

- **Advanced**: Python, SQL, Deep Learning, Machine Learning
- **Intermediate**: NLP, Generative AI, Data Analysis, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Beginner**: R, C++, Core Java

## Achievements & Certifications
I'm proud of my contributions to the AIOps core team at Wipro, where I was recognized as Rookie of the Quarter. My certifications include a Post Graduate Certification in AI & ML from BITS Pilani, Dynatrace Associate, and TOSCA Automation Specialist.

## Beyond Tech
I am actively involved in community service through NGOs like Nature Lovers Pune and Lions Club International, focusing on environmental conservation and supporting special needs education.
