BERT for Question Answering
This repository showcases a project focused on enhancing the BERT model for the task of question answering. The implementation includes several strategies to improve performance and efficiency.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to fine-tune a BERT-uncased model to effectively answer questions based on a given context. The following key strategies were implemented:

1. Fine-Tuning BERT
Fine-Tuning: Adapted the pre-trained BERT-uncased model from Hugging Face specifically for the question-answering task. This involved adjusting the model to learn the start and end positions of answer spans in a text.
2. DocStride Implementation
DocStride: To manage long documents exceeding the maximum input length, the context is split into overlapping chunks. This approach ensures that the model retains access to all relevant parts of the document when determining the answer.
3. Learning Rate Scheduler
Learning Rate Scheduling: Integrated a cosine learning rate scheduler to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training. This helps the model converge efficiently while minimizing overfitting risks.
4. Optimization Techniques
Optimization: Leveraged the Adam optimizer, known for its efficiency, particularly in handling sparse gradients. This, combined with the scheduler, optimizes model performance and generalization.
Key Takeaways
DocStride: Facilitates handling of long contexts by splitting them into manageable chunks.
Learning Rate Scheduling: Improves model convergence and generalization by dynamically adjusting the learning rate.
Fine-Tuning: Tailors the BERT model specifically to the question-answering task, enhancing accuracy and relevance.
